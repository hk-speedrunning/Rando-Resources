## [Races](Formats.md)

In races, especially team formats, please be mindful of your teammates and opponents - try not to join races you won't be able to finish, though we understand emergencies (and awful seeds) happen. Your first finished rando shouldn't be in a race!

Using the spoiler log in non-spoiler races **_is cheating_**, and is a bannable offense.

A list of formats with time estimates can be found [here](Formats.md).
